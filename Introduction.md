# Beginner Tutorial for Julia

Beginner tutorial for Julia! 

## Basic Syntax

### Variables

Variables in Julia are created using the assignment operator `=`. For example:

```julia
x = 1
y = 2
z = x + y
```

This will set the value of `x` to 1, the value of `y` to 2, and the value of `z` to 3.

### Arrays

Arrays in Julia can be created using the square bracket notation. For example:

```julia
A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
```

This will create a 3x3 array with the values `[1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]`.

### Control Flow

Julia supports standard control flow statements such as `if`, `for`, and `while`. For example:

```julia
x = 10

if x > 0
    println("x is positive")
elseif x < 0
    println("x is negative")
else
    println("x is zero")
end
```

This will print the message "x is positive" to the console.

### Functions

Functions in Julia are defined using the `function` keyword. For example:

```julia
function myfunction(x, y)
    z = x + y
    return z
end
```

This will define a function called `myfunction` that takes two arguments `x` and `y`, adds them together, and returns the result.

To call this function, you would simply pass in the arguments:

```julia
result = myfunction(1, 2)
```

This would set the value of `result` to 3.
